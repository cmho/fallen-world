# Fallen World

[[Tell Me More]]! aka what is this, what is happen

## MC Prep

* [[Agendas]]
* [[Principles]]

## Setting Information

I'll do this later, it's less important to actually being able to play it and I can just explain it

## Character Creation

1. Select a Path (see below); this will determine what magic you are best at. During this step, also choose a name, look, and nimbus. Set your attributes to the ones given by your Path; your Order moves may modify these later.
2. Set your Gnosis=0.
3. Add 1 to one of your stats.
4. Select an Order (see below). This will give you a set of moves to choose from. You will be able to buy more as advances later.
5. Go around the table and introduce yourselves by Shadow Name, Path, Look and Order, and give a brief description of your character.
6. Go around the table again and determine your Sympathy to one another, as per the instructions on your Order playbook.
7. Find the person who has the highest Sympathy to you. If there's more than one, just pick one. Ask them to highlight one of your stats. The ST will highlight another one. When you roll the highlighted stats, you mark experience.
8. [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Setting definition step—define your city, who's in charge of the mages in it, what kinds of troubles there have been
9. [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Sanctum definition step—define the cabal's chantry, and its features and drawbacks

### Paths

All would-be mages walk a path in their dreams or in a waking mystery-play that leads them to one of the Watchtowers. There, they sign their name in a book, accepting magic into themselves.

The paths call differently to different people; some of those they choose may be surprising. They all leave their mark on their chosen, though.

* [[Acanthus]] (The Enchanter)
* [[Mastigos]] (The Warlock)
* [[Moros]] (The Necromancer)
* [[Obrimos]] (The Theurge)
* [[Thyrsus]] (The Shaman)

### Orders

The Awakened are not many in number, compared to those who yet sleep, but there are enough that they have formed organizations and hierarchies. While they all share a common purpose, they each focus on a different part of bringing that purpose to fruition.

The five major orders taken together are known as the Pentacle. Those who do not belong to any of them are known as Apostates.

* [[Adamantine Arrow]] - the military wing of the Pentacle orders, which protects Awakened society from outside threats.
* [[Free Council]] - scientists, free-thinkers and innovators whose new ideas keep others on their toes.
* [[Guardians of the Veil]] - the police of the Awakened, who keep knowledge of arcane mysteries from those who are not yet ready for them.
* [[Mysterium]] - Awakened society's lore-keepers, dedicated scholars and librarians.
* [[Silver Ladder]] - always in mind of the bigger picture, the Silver Ladder manipulates the wider world to be more receptive to the Truth.
* [[Apostate]] - those who operate outside established Awakened society, with their own agenda.

## Setting Creation

Where do the characters live? What is life like there as a mage? What unique problems does this place have, and what rewards does it offer? Decide on these things together as a group—these will set the tone for the kind of stories the characters will find themselves in.

[[Setting Creation]]

## Sanctum Creation

In addition to living in the same city, the characters as a group—their *cabal*—have a secret, safe place where they can work magic in peace. Define this place together using the following instructions.

[[Sanctum Creation]]

## Gameplay

* [[Basic Moves]]
* [[MC Moves]]

### Spells

Spells are cast using the **Cast a Spell** [Basic Move](Basic Moves). 

You may optionally codify a spell by using an Advance (see below), and permanently adding it as one of your moves, using a non-Gnosis stat the Storyteller deems appropriate. Spells codified in this way are called **Rotes** and receive one fewer consequence on a 7-9 roll, and receive bonus effects on a 10+.

You may only purchase spells as Rotes from your Superior Arcana, unless you've taken the advance that allows you to create Rotes from other Arcana. You may never have Rotes under the purview of your Path's Inferior Arcanum.

### Experience

A player marks experience when:

* You roll a highlighted stat.
* Your Sympathy with someone resets from Sympathy+4 to Sympathy+1 or from Sympathy-4 to Sympathy-1.
* A move tells you to—one of yours, someone else's, or a custom move.

### Advancement

When you mark 5 experience, you gain an Advance, which must be used immediately. Choose from the list below.

* Take another move from your Order moves. (twice only)
* Create a spell and add it to your sheet as a Move using the process described above.
* Take a move from your Path. (twice only)
* Take a move from a different Path. (twice only)
* Take an Arcane Experience.
* Take the ability to purchase rote spells from outside your path's Superior Arcana, excepting your Inferior Arcanum.
* +1 Strength (once only, max +3)
* +1 Intelligence (once only, max +3)
* +1 Manipulation (once only, max +3)
* +1 Composure (once only, max +3)
* [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] Gain a [Familiar](Familiars).

Starting with your 6th Advance, you may take the following:

* Get +1 to any stat (max +3)
* Retire your character (to safety), and create a new character to play.
* Create a second character to play, so now you're playing two.
* Choose 3 basic moves and advance them.
* Advance the rest of the basic moves.
* ???

Advancing a basic move means adding a new level of success to it, for rolls that hit with a 12+. When you advance a move, the MC will tell you about its new capabilities.

### Arcane Advancement

You have a separate experience track for tracking your *Arcane Experience*, which grows more slowly but is the way that you increase your Gnosis. When you accumulate 5 Arcane Experience, you may take +1 Gnosis. (And should; there's nothing else you can spend this on.) You can do this to a maximum of Gnosis+3.

In addition to receiving Arcane Experience from advances, you may also receive it at the ST's discretion when you have solved or otherwise dealt with some kind of major arcane mystery and grown in knowledge of the hidden world. This would usually be at the end of a story arc or after a particularly big-deal victory.
