The Adamantine Arrow is the military wing of the Awakened. While the [[Guardians of the Veil]] deal with threats from within and the threat of discovery, the Arrow is called upon when the time for subtlety is pastâ€”when the Awakened are under siege from external forces great and terrible.

While some act as healers or planners, all of them are capable fighters, and formidable in combat. Magic and this Fallen World must be protected, and those who can must do.

## Sympathy

On your turn, choose 1 or both:

* You've fought side-by-side with [Name] and trust them to have your back. Tell that player Sympathy+2.
* [Name] let you down in a pinch, once, and you haven't forgotten it. Tell that player Sympathy-1.

Tell everyone else Sympathy+1. You favor the straightforward approach.

On everyone else's turns:

* Decide which one you think is the strongest. Take whatever they tell you and give it +1.
* Everyone else, whatever number they tell you, write it down next to their character's name.

## Moves

You have:

* **Defender of the Fallen World:** Whenever you put yourself in harm's way to protect others, mark experience.

* **Combat Sorcerer:** When in an active combat, you may roll+strength when casting spells in the service of that combat.
