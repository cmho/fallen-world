## Why an Apocalypse World hack?

So, I'm very big on story games—the World of Darkness games are ostensibly story-centric games, but I feel like oftentimes the story gets bogged down in the details and rules minutiae.

In Apocalypse World the answer to "why do we care about the characters" boils down to "they're a bunch of hot messes and we want to see how they collide", and I feel like that's sort of the sweet spot for where I want to be with most World of Darkness games.

Also, for a game about power and what you do with it, a system where most of the story rests on the MC asking you "So what do you do?" seems like a good fit.

Basically, the idea is to pare everything down to the central themes and hack off everything that detracts from good story, while still keeping some of the flexibility that World of Darkness games usually have.

## So what am I going to have to relearn

GOOD QUESTION. Apocalypse-powered games trim down the stats considerably, so you're only going to have five core ones.

You've got **Strength**, physical power, the power to save yourself from harm or beat down someone who's trying to bring *you* down from your rightful place.

Then there's **Intelligence**, the power of knowledge, the secrets and processes you keep in your head that solve mysteries and find you leverage.

**Manipulation** is the power to get others to do what you want, whether it's cajoling, bargaining, trust-building, or seducing.

The power you have over yourself is **Composure**—the ability to hold steady, to be calm, collected and unflappable despite all the obstacles in your path to greatness.

And then there's your **Gnosis**, the raw magical power you have at your command, the power to make the universe itself do whatever you command.

The first four stats are given by your Path; your Gnosis starts at gnosis=0. This doesn't mean you aren't a mage—it just means your modifier for rolling on things that involve it is 0 to start out with.

And that's it! Whenever you want to do something, roll 2d6 and make your move. Add the relevant stat (it'll usually be defined in your Moves) and find out what happens!

## Okay so what is this Sympathy thing

Sympathy is the relationships you have with other people, either positive or negative—a measure of how much has happened between you. Some moves allow you to use your Sympathy instead of the usual stat, leveraging your relationship for results.

When you mark 4 Sympathy with another character, reset the track and mark experience.

## Where the heck is my spell list

THERE ISN'T ONE

I realized that one of the things I was trying to rectify here was having to comb through the ENDLESS SPELL LISTS every damn time anyone wants to do anything, which is boring

so it's creative thaum ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME aw yeeeeee sky's the limit just make stuff up

you can codify spells that you make up as Rotes (see the main page, and the spellcasting rules in [[Basic Moves]]), which grants you special additional bonuses and makes your life a little easier. also tbh I'm not going to stop you if you crib spell ideas from the books and that's a really good starting place probably; in the final version I might have a list of sample rotes that people can take as advances, but a lot of spells need modification to make them useful in this version, so I wanna see what people do with magic first

Also some of the spells I rolled into Basic Moves because people do them literally all the time anyway which makes them basic; your mage sights are now **See Beyond**, for example, and all spellcasting is covered by **Cast a Spell**.

## Where's the stuff about mana and willpower and everything

At least in this iteration I'm going to try and do this without any resource mechanics. I think there are more interesting ways to limit problem-solving with magic, and it's really boring when the action has to stop for everyone to replenish their stuff. Will this work? WHO KNOWS! We'll find out.

Don't get too excited about free spellcasting, though, because I made paradox terrible

*You're welcome*

## So after all of that why should I agree to playtest this mess

because I will bake you stuff

that's pretty much all I got so I hope you like baked goods
