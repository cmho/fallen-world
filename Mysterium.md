The Mysterium are the guardians of knowledge among the Awakened. While others may collect lore and artifacts on their own, the Mysterium have the lion's share in their collections—and encourage you to contribute yours for safe-keeping, and the betterment of the collective knowledge.

While some may spend a lot of time delving into ancient crypts and vaults and crossing faraway jungles and deserts to unearth the secrets hidden within, all of them are at heart scholars who do what they do for the pursuit and advancement of knowledge.

## Sympathy

* [Name] provided you some information that was very valuable to your research. Tell them +1.

Tell everyone else =0—you're more invested in your studies than in people, but you don't go out of your way to avoid people.
