## Apprentice Spells (Gnosis=0)

### Corpse Mask

You may alter the appearance of how someone died by adding or subtracting one feature from the corpse left behind.

### Decay [Vulgar]

You cause a material object to corrode, rust, or rot. At gnosis+1, you may similarly affect ephemeral objects in Twilight, and instantly destroy most material objects. At gnosis+2, you may attack living flesh in this way, causing (some amount of harm).

### Ectoplasm [Vulgar]

You can shape pre-existing ectoplasm, or excrete it from one of your own orifices or those of a corpse. The substance may be used as a mirror to allow anyone to see ghosts, or to allow a Twilight-bound ghost to manifest.

### Forensic Gaze

From a dead body, you may discern the exact time and cause of death, even if physical evidence of the cause of death is absent or has been destroyed.

### Ghost Summons



Combine w/ Speak With Dead; upgrade to Control Ghost at Gnosis 1, upgrade to Summon the Dead at Gnosis 3

### Shadow Sculpting

You may shape existing shadow in your immediate area. If using the shadow to hide, you carry 1 forward to stay hidden. You may even cause shadow to move to places where it would not naturally fall, although in doing so the spell becomes [Vulgar].

At gnosis+1, you may create shadow, rather than relying on already-existing darkness.

### Soul Marks

You perceive the health of the targeted person's soul. You may ask one of the following questions:

* Has this person experienced some kind of past trauma?
* Has this person created a Soul Stone, or otherwise externalized a part of their soul?
* Has this person's soul been acted upon by some kind of supernatural force?

### Suppress Aura

The caster temporarily suppresses their own aura, making it more difficult for others to read. Anyone attempting to read the caster's aura takes a -1 penalty.

At gnosis+2, the caster may destroy their own aura entirely, rendering it impossible to read even with the best efforts.

### Touch of the Grave

For a short period of time, you may reach through to the Twilight realm and interact with ghosts and ghostly things in a Twilight state. These ghostly objects can be used in the material world.

However, it works the other way around; the caster may be touched or attacked by ghosts in this state.

At gnosis+1, the caster may turn a material object into a ghostly one.

## Disciple Spells (Gnosis+1)

### Devouring the Slain [Vulgar]

When you have someone at your mercy, you may do harm to them to carry 1 forward on a future spell of your choice, 1 for 1.

### Ghost Gate [Vulgar]

You create a gate to the Twilight realm, where ghosts and spirits dwell, and where anyone who enters may interact with ghosts.

### Quicken Corpse [Vulgar]

From a corpse, you may create an ambulatory, devoted servant, mostly useful for doing tasks that require little thought or initiative.

### Restore Corpus [Vulgar]

You may heal a ghost of 1 harm.

### Sculpt Ephemera [Vulgar]

You may sculpt or shore up the substance of inanimate objects and places within Twilight or the Shadow Realm.

### Sever the Sleeping Soul [Vulgar]

You may ritually sever the soul from a Sleeper who you have at your mercy.

### Soul Jar

This creates a receptacle that can be used to store a soul, preventing its release to its next destination. The container may be anything used to store a liquid. The soul can be stored indefinitely.

### Suppress Own Life

You may temporarily suppress your own life, appearing and being truly dead. Aside from decomposition, your body will have all the symptoms of true death, and the mind and spirit will be absent. The return to life comes with a pre-determined trigger, or after an hour.

At gnosis+2, you may cast this spell on others.

If the target was "dead" for an extended period of time, the visible effects take some time to go away, and they receive the condition "Corpselike."

## Adept Spells (Gnosis+2)

### Enervation

You may draw the strength of life from a living person's body, leaving them weak.

### Haunting [Vulgar]

You may cause a recently dead or dying Sleeper to cling to a physical anchor rather than move on after death.

### Revenant [Vulgar]

You may prevent a recently-dead Sleeper's spiritual release, if it's been less than an hour since the target's death. It forces the soul to remain in the body, which will not decompose until the end of the scene.

The target may be a dead mage at gnosis+3, but they will no longer be able to cast spells.

### Soul Binding [Vulgar]

You may attach a stolen soul to yourself or someone else, but only if the target currently has no soul.

### Twilight Shift [Vulgar]

You may shift yourself into Twilight state without needing to pass through or create a gateway.

## Master Spells (Gnosis+3)

### Quell the Spark

### Quicken Ghost

### Steal Lifespan
