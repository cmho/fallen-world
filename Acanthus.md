Choose 1:

* **Destined:** Choose another character you have met. You have seen the threads of fate, and know that their destiny is intwined with yours, for better or for worse. When rolling with Sympathy toward that character, count your rating as 2 higher. Conversely, they gain the same benefit toward you.
* **Lucky:** Once per session, treat a failure as a 10+ success.
* **Oracle:** When you gaze into the eddies of time to get a glimpse of what might come of the current situation, roll+Gnosis. On a 10+, the visions are detailed and lucid. On a 7-9, choose one: the visions are detailed but leave you feeling *Drained*; the visions are confusing and alarming.
* **Geas:** When someone makes a promise to you, it's magically protected. When they break a promise to you, wherever they are, their situation turns sour and they take the condition *Unlucky*.
* **Postcognition:** When you **see beyond**, the echoes of the past make themselves known to you. On a hit, include the following in the list of questions to choose from:
    * What was the most recent significant event to happen here?
    * What transpired here that is connected to our situation?
    * What has changed here?
* **Efficient:** something about rituals not taking as much time? spells getting an additional time rating for free???
* **Just Happened To Pack It:** Whenever something you're doing requires an inexpensive, common item to accomplish, you coincidentally thought to pack just that thing that morning.
