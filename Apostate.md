It's unusual for mages to eschew joining any kind of Awakened society—largely because the benefits and the community make going it alone an unattractive proposition. Furthermore, many mages view Apostates—mages outside an Order—as suspicious.

That said, there are not a few who do choose that path, for a variety of reasons. Some have their own uncompromisable ideals to follow; others don't find they fit in with any established society. Others are forced out because of dark deeds, or just one too many mistake.

However, walking the path of magic alone, free from traditions or preconceptions, can lend unusual insight into the ways of the universe...

## Sympathy

On your turn:

* [Name] did you a good turn once, even though they didn't have any reason to trust you. Tell them +2.

Tell everyone else -1. No one trusts an apostate; it's understandable.

On everyone else's turn:

* Take what they tell you and give it a +1 or a -1. Your choice.


## Moves

You have: 

* **Fight For Your Right To Party:** When you rebel against the orders of those more powerful or influential, mark experience.

Choose 2 others:

* **On My Own:** When you face a challenge alone, take +1.
* **Code of Honor:** Your lack of affiliation doesn't mean you also lack standards. Write down 3 tenets that you always do your best to abide by. If failing to **keep your cool** would cause you to violate one of these tenets, you get a +1 to roll. However, if you violate one on your own, the ST chooses a consequence as if you rolled a partial success in casting a spell.
* **Off the Beaten Path:** Your unconventional studies have given you insight into areas of magic that you might not have gained otherwise. You may ignore the penalty to casting spells from your Inferior Arcanum.
* **Jack of All Trades:** Once per session, if your Gnosis is higher than the required stat, you may roll+gnosis instead.
* **Trial By Fire:** Whenever you fail at casting a spell, with consequences, mark experience.
