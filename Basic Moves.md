## See Beyond

When you **open your eyes to the flow of magic around you**, roll with Gnosis. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 1.

* What here is supernatural or unnatural?
* Is a supernatural ability being used?
* What does this area's resonance feel like?
* How does the area around me relate to the kinds of magic my Path is attuned to?

## Cast a Spell

When you **mold reality to serve your purposes**, roll with Gnosis. On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast. On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose 1:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The ST will tell you how.
* The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—you and an additional number of people equal to your Gnosis take an ongoing -1 to cast a spell, and you take an additional -1 to cast similar spells until the next time you're able to take a substantial amount of time to refresh yourself.
* The spell disorients you and unsettles your mind temporarily. The ST gives you a Condition of their choosing.
* You fail to properly enforce your will on reality, causing the spell to fade more quickly than usual.
* The spell—if targeted at something or someone else—misfires at a target of the ST's choosing instead.

If the spell is obviously unnatural or is cast in a way that stretches belief, choose two of the above (or three if you have gnosis+3).

On a 6 or below, the spell goes haywire or fizzles out, and the Storyteller chooses the consequences.

### Level of Influence

More seasoned mages can create more powerful effects. The effects that you can create at each level of Gnosis are as follows:

| Gnosis | Effects                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 0      | Knowing, compelling, unveiling |
| 1      | Ruling, veiling, shielding, Weaving, fraying, perfecting |
| 2      | Patterning, unravelling        |
| 3      | Making, unmaking               |

If the effect you wish to create is above your current usual ability, roll with a -1 penalty.

### Spell Duration

The length of time your spells last is related to your Gnosis. If you wish for your spell to last longer, take a -1.

| Gnosis | Default Duration |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 0      | Scene            |
| 1      | Day              |
| 2      | Week             |
| 3      | Month            |

### Modifiers and Special Situations

If the spell is affecting something under the purview of your Superior Arcana, take a +1. If it's your Inferior Arcana, you're at a -1.

If the spell incorporates more than one Arcana, take a -1 for each additional Arcanum beyond the first.

If you're trying to affect more than one target, take a -1 for each additional target.

If you're casting on a target with which you have Sympathy, add your Sympathy to cast. If you're trying to cast a spell on someone you can't see and don't have Sympathy to them, take a -1.

If you're casting a spell at a Place of Power, cast with a +1.

### Rote Bonus Effects

For spells that have been codified as Rotes, on a 10+ you may select a number of bonus effects equal to your Gnosis. These may be selected more than once, unless otherwise noted.

* The spell's effect is amplified.
* You receive +1Sympathy to the target. If this puts you at Sympathy+4, reset to Sympathy+1 and mark experience. If the spell affects multiple targets, pick one only.
* The spell affects an additional target.
* The spell lasts for a category of time longer than it normally would. (See chart above, under Spell Duration.)
* You carry 1 forward to your next spellcasting.

## Perform a Ritual

When you **draw on a place of power to create a powerful magical effect**, tell the ST what you want it to do. The effects will always be possible, but the ST will give you one to four of the following conditions:

* It's going to take days/weeks/months
* First you must X
* You'll need help from X
* It will require a lot of money or unusual components
* The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited
* You and your allies will risk danger from X

## Overtake By Force

When you **overtake your foes with force**, roll with Strength. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2:

* You have a hold over your enemy, or if they had an advantage over you, you completely escape their influence
* You suffer little harm
* You inflict terrible harm
* You impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy

## Keep Your Cool

When you **keep your cool in the face of trouble, manipulation, or mind control**, roll with Composure. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7-9, you flinch, hesitate or stall: the ST can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.

## Understand the Situation

When you **attempt to better understand an uncertain situation**, roll with Intelligence. Whenever you act on one of the ST's answers, take +1. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:

* Who's really in control here?
* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is useful or valuable to me?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

## Consult Your Knowledge

When you **recall important information about something**, roll with Intelligence. On a 10+, the ST will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7-9, the ST will only tell you something interesting—it's on you to make it useful.

## Seduce or Manipulate

When you **try to seduce or manipulate someone**, roll with Manipulation. For NPCs: On a hit, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you. On a 10+, whether you keep your promise is up to you. On a 7-9, they need some concrete assurance right now. For PCs: On a 10+, both. On a 7-9, choose 1:

* If they do it, they mark experience
* If they refuse, it's acting under fire

What they do is up to them.

## Help or Interfere

When you **help** or **interfere with** someone who's making their move, roll+Sympathy. On a hit, they take +1 (help) or -1 (interfere). On a 7-9, you also expose yourself to fire, danger, retribution or cost.

## Session End

**At the end of every session**, choose a character who knows you better than they used to. If it's more than one, choose one at your whim. Tell that player to add +1 to their Sympathy with you on their sheet. If this brings them to Sympathy+4, they reset to Sympathy+1 and mark experience.
