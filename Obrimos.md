## Moves

Choose one of the following:

* **Hallowed:** You are naturally attuned to the magical forces of the world. When casting spells near a place of power, you get an extra effect on a success.
* **Filled with Glorious Purpose:** Your character is strongly faithful to a set of ideals, whether personal or religious. Write down a handful of principles that represent that faith. When your character specifically acts on these principles in the face of peril, take +1.
* **Charged:** You can summon a small, helpful amount of energy—a lighter-sized flame, a flashlight's amount of light, an hour's battery charge—once per scene.
* **As Above:** When you **see beyond** to analyze something magical, you may additionally ask these questions:
    * Is what I am seeing real?
    * What is this magic's purpose?
    * How was this magic wrought?
