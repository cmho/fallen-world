The Free Council is a late addition to the major orders of Awakened society, but an important one. Born from a collection of like-minded smaller study groups, it has coalesced itself into a collective of keen-minded innovators and revolutionary thinkers. They may not have the strength of tradition behind them, but, to them, tradition isn't as interesting as coming up with new methods.

Befitting their origins, the Free Council contains members from every walk of lifeâ€”fighters, scientists, writers, philosophers, engineers, dreamers. What they have in common is that they are certain that the way to Awaken the world will come from trying new things.

## Sympathy

On your turn:

* You've competed with [Name] for accomplishments, and you have to admit they're on your level. Tell them +2.

Tell everyone else +1. Whether they love you or hate you, people can't help but remember you.

On everyone else's turn:

* Pick whoever seems the most unique and interesting. Take whatever they tell you and give it +1.
* Decide who you feel is held back the most by tradition and needs to loosen up. Ignore what they tell you and write -1.

## Moves

You have:

* **I'm Just In It For The Science:** When you indulge your curiosity, mark experience.

Choose 2 others:

* **Inventor:** You have a workspace that's useful for making things and experimentation. Choose 3: a garage, a darkroom, a chemistry lab, skilled labor, meters magical and mundane, booby traps, machining tools, a truck or van, an Artifact of the era of magic.
* **Opinionated:** When you attempt to convince someone of a cause you feel passionately about, take 1 forward.
* **Do Science To It:** When **Seeing Beyond** on some never-before-seen phenomena, you may ask one extra question on a hit.
* **Free Thinker:** You get +1 to an attribute of your choice.
* **Just The Facts:** When you're trying to shut someone down in conversation, roll+Intelligence instead of Composure. You're just thinking logically, after all.
