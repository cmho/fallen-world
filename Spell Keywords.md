The spellcasting system in Fallen World is a lot more freeform than its older, more robust sibling's, and therefore it can become kind of fuzzy telling what Arcanum or Arcana are being used in a spell to determine the appropriate modifiers.

If they describe their spell including a word like:

**Death:** Decay, ghost, corpse, old, soul

**Fate:** Luck, chance, odds

**Forces:** Power, fire, electricity, gravity

**Life:** Health, poison, illness, body

**Matter:** Object, durability, quality

**Mind:** Thoughts, feelings, emotions

**Prime:** Magic, aura, mana, enchant

**Space:** Location, distance, connection

**Spirit:** Guardian

**Time:** Past, future, speed, slow
