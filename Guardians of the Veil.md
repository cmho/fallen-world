The world, still fallen, is not yet ready for the knowledge of magic, and the Guardians of the Veil are the ones who make sure the secrets of the Awakened do not reach the wrong ears. While this may seem at odds with the ideal of an entire Awakened world, the Guardians know that change cannot happen too quickly or too soon, especially when the Abyss's malevolent, watchful specter hovers over all willworkers.

They know all too well of the hubris of the Awakened, and what it can lead to. What they do, they do because they must, even if they're hated for it.

## Sympathy

On your turn:

* You've had to bail [Name] out of trouble too many times for your liking. Tell them -2.

Tell everyone else -1.

On everyone else's turn:

* Take what they tell you and give it -1.

## Moves

You have:

* **Necessary Evils:** When you take on the burden of doing what is necessary to protect the secrets of the hidden world, mark experience.

Choose 2 others:

* **Cipher:** You're hard to read. You have +1Composure.
* **Many Faces:** When you step out of sight for a moment, you may make yourself nigh unrecognizable. It's up to you to act the part, but even suspicious individuals will have trouble recalling if they've seen you before.
* **Occultation:** You are mystically occluded from others' interference, whether mundane or magical. When others try to use Sympathy to target you, treat it as a rank lower. However, this protection has a costâ€”even helpful effects take this same penalty. (If you're targeting yourself with a spell, it doesn't count.)
* **Blind Eye:** Gaze into someone's eyes and roll+Manipulation. On a hit, they forget what you tell them to. On a miss, you must answer a question of theirs.
* **Cool Customer:** When you try to **seduce or manipulate** someone, roll with Composure instead of Manipulation.
